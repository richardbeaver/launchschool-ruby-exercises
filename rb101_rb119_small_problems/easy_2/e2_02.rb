# How big is the room?

# Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in
# meters and then displays the area of the room in both square meters and
# square feet.

# Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

# Do not worry about validating the input at this time.

# Example Run
# Enter the length of the room in meters:
# 10
# Enter the width of the room in meters:
# 7
# The area of the room is 70.0 square meters (753.47 square feet).

# ==============================================

SQMETERS_TO_SQFEET = 10.7639

puts 'Enter the length of the room in meters:'
length = gets.chomp.to_f

puts 'Enter the width of the room in meters:'
width = gets.chomp.to_f

square_meters = (length * width).round(2)
square_feet = (square_meters * SQMETERS_TO_SQFEET).round(2)

puts "The area of the room is #{square_meters} square meters " \
     "(#{square_feet} square feet)."
